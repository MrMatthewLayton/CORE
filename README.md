# CORE

### A modern, general purpose library for .NET

CORE stands for **C**ommon **O**bject **R**untime **E**xtension. It is designed to complement .NET with (even more), modern, general purpose APIs. The primary objective of CORE development is to identify commonly used enterprise patterns and practices, and to provide a baseline implementation, such that these patterns and practices can become aligned across enterprises.
